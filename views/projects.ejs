                This website is very much still under progress and will be improved as time goes on. 
                It's a project for an assignment for the class COMP229 that I am currently working on. 
                It uses the ExpressJS as well as Bootstrap 5 for the styles! The outcome of this project is
                to become my main portfolio website to show to the recruiters!

            <td>
                A game where you pop as many balloons as you can under a time limit! I made it with Python, specifically the pygame
                module using the PyCharm IDE. I learned how to make the UI for the menu as well as a slide bar
                for the volume in the settings menu. The outcome of this project is to learn more and experiment
                for myself what Python can do!
